    "# Project 3: Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will explore two deep learning applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built on the dataset from Project 2, evaluated against classical machine learning methods.\n",
    "2. A Kaggle-style CIFAR-10 Image Classification Challenge using CNNs and transfer learning, with an emphasis on thoughtful experimentation and model analysis. (The same CIFAR-10 dataset from Project 2, so refer to Project 2 to retrieve the data)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "As part of this project, you should deliver the following materials:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An **IEEE-format paper**. [Here is a Latex template you can use in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn) Write a paper addressing the tasks posed below (no page limit). When writing this report, consider a business-oriented person as your reader (e.g. your PhD advisor, your internship manager, etc.). Tell the story for each datasets' goal and propose solutions by addressing (at least) the tasks posed below. **Due April 28th at 11:59pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python Code**. Create AT LEAST two separate Notebooks: (1) \"training.ipynb\" used for training and hyperparameter tuning, (2) \"test.ipynb\" for evaluating the final trained model in the test set. The \"test.ipynb\" should load all trained objects and simply evaluate the performance. So don't forget to push the trained models to your repository to allow us to run it. **YOU CAN HAVE MORE NOTEBOOKS IF YOU CONSIDER IT** **Due Monday, April 21 @ 11:59pm.** Late submissions will not be accepted, so please plan accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **README.md file**. Edit the readme.md file in your repository and how to use your code. If there are user-defined parameters, your readme.md file must clearly indicate so and demonstrate how to use your code. **Due April 28th at 11:59pm**\n",

    "## Section 1 — ANN vs Classical Models (Project 2 Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will reuse the dataset you selected and worked on in Project 2 (e.g., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10). Your task is to build and evaluate an artificial neural network (ANN) and compare its performance to the classical models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) that you previously implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks (Include details of this in the report)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design and Train an ANN**\n",
    "   - Use Keras\n",
    "   - Tune architecture: number of hidden layers, activation functions, dropout, optimizer, batch size, etc.\n",
    "   - Report training and validation accuracy, training time, F1-score, and confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare with Classical Models**\n",
    "   - Use your best-performing models from Project 2 (with and without dimensionality reduction).\n",
    "   - Evaluate on the same dataset split.\n",
    "   - Record and compare metrics: accuracy, F1-score (macro), training time, inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Analysis**\n",
    "   - Discuss how and why performance differs between the ANN and classical models.\n",
    "   - Explain the limitations of each approach in relation to the dataset characteristics and dimensionality.\n",
    "   - Provide thoughtful, model-driven justification (not just reporting numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradio Inference Interface**\n",
    "   - Implement a minimal Gradio UI that allows users to upload or draw a sample image and receive the predicted class from the trained ANN.\n",
    "   - Provide clear usage instructions in the README or notebook.\n",
    "   - Include a screenrecording (demo) of the interface in your README file.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will participate in a competition-style challenge to build the most accurate model for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a multi-class image classifier for CIFAR-10 using a modeling approach of your choice. \n",

    "### Model Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose one or more of the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CNN from Scratch**  \n",
    "  Design your own convolutional architecture tailored to the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transfer Learning**  \n",
    "  Use pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet) with frozen or fine-tuned layers.\n",

    "### How the Competition Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will train your model(s) using the CIFAR-10 training set (50,000 images).\n",
    "- The official test set (10,000 images, no labels) will be released **on April 17th EOD**.\n",
    "- You will generate predictions on this test set and commit a CSV in the following format: ID,PredictedLabel 0001,3 0002,8 0003,0 ...\n",
    "    -  `ID` refers to the image file name (e.g., `0001.png`)\n",
    "    - `PredictedLabel` is the integer class (0–9), where: 0 = airplane 1 = automobile 2 = bird 3 = cat 4 = deer 5 = dog 6 = frog 7 = horse 8 = ship 9 = truck\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You will only receive one test set. There is no public leaderboard --> I will release it on the poster presentation session. Your submission will be evaluated internally based on ``accuracy`` and ``macro F1-score``. **This will not count as part of the project grade, it is just for the competition!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name the file `yourname_section2_submission.csv\n",

    "- ``add`` and ``commit`` only one prediction file — no resubmissions.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Improve Your Model**\n",
    "   - Use data augmentation and regularization.\n",
